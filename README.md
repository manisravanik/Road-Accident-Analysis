With increasing population growth and the rise in vehicle ownership, traffic congestion has surged, leading to a high risk of road accidents. Various factors including weather, time 
of day and traffic patterns contribute to accident severity. There is a need for accurate prediction of accident risks to enable proactive measures that can reduce accidents, save lives, and
enhance overall road safety. This project aims to analyze traffic data by identifying rush hours, examining severity distribution, determining the top accident-prone states, evaluating the
number of accidents by day of the week, and pinpointing hotspots using Folium. Additionally, it investigates the impact of weather conditions and develops a model to classify accident 
severity based on weather and road conditions.
